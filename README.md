# EXP-3-IoT-Based-Remote-Control-System-for-Electric-Vehicles-Using-MATLAB-ThingSpeak

## AIM
To design and implement an IoT-based remote control system for an electric vehicle (EV) using MATLAB and ThingSpeak API. The system enables remote operations such as:
•	Locking/Unlocking doors
•	Starting/Stopping the engine
•	Turning lights ON/OFF
The MATLAB script communicates with ThingSpeak, which acts as an intermediary between MATLAB and an embedded system (ESP32).
 
## THEORY
1. Internet of Things (IoT) in Electric Vehicles
IoT enables remote monitoring and control of EV systems using cloud-based communication. By integrating MATLAB with ThingSpeak, users can send control signals and retrieve the vehicle’s status remotely.
2. ThingSpeak Cloud Platform
ThingSpeak is a cloud-based IoT analytics platform that allows:
✅ Data collection from embedded devices
✅ Remote command transmission using APIs
✅ Real-time monitoring and visualization
3. Working Principle
1.	User Inputs Command in MATLAB → e.g., "Start Engine"
2.	MATLAB Sends Command to ThingSpeak API
3.	ESP32 Reads Command from ThingSpeak and performs the action
4.	ESP32 Updates Status on ThingSpeak
5.	MATLAB Reads Status from ThingSpeak and displays it
 
## PROCEDURE
🔹 Step 1: Setup ThingSpeak Account
1.	Create a Free ThingSpeak Account → https://thingspeak.com
2.	Create a New Channel and Add Two Fields: 
o	Field 1 → Control Commands
o	Field 2 → EV Status
3.	Note Down the Write & Read API Keys
🔹 Step 2: Implement MATLAB Code
1.	Open MATLAB and create a new script.
2.	Copy and paste the MATLAB code (provided earlier).
3.	Replace YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY, YOUR_READ_API_KEY, and YOUR_CHANNEL_ID with your ThingSpeak credentials.
4.	Run the script and select an action from the menu.
🔹 Step 3: ESP32 Integration (Optional)
1.	ESP32 reads the command from ThingSpeak using Wi-Fi.
2.	Executes the command (e.g., turns ON engine).
3.	Updates the EV status back to ThingSpeak.
🔹 Step 4: Display Vehicle Status in MATLAB
1.	MATLAB retrieves the latest EV status from ThingSpeak.
2.	Displays the confirmation message to the user.



## MATLAB Code (Without MQTT Client Toolbox) 

clear; clc;

% Define ThingSpeak API Details

writeAPIKey = 'V2S0VAJSKF2AWXV0'; % Your ThingSpeak Write API Key

readAPIKey = '93MNWOT35L9CPBWM'; % Your ThingSpeak Read API Key

channelID = '3114957'; % Your ThingSpeak Channel ID

% Remote Control Menu

disp('Choose a remote function:');

disp('1 - Lock Doors');

disp('2 - Unlock Doors');

disp('3 - Start Engine');

disp('4 - Stop Engine');

disp('5 - Turn On Lights');

disp('6 - Turn Off Lights');

choice = input('Enter your choice (1-6): ');

% Define EV control commands

commands = ["LOCK", "UNLOCK", "START", "STOP", "LIGHT_ON", "LIGHT_OFF"];

% Validate choice and send command

if choice >= 1 && choice <= 6

commandSent = commands(choice);

% CORRECTED: Proper URL construction for ThingSpeak

url = ['https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=', writeAPIKey, '&field1=', char(commandSent)];

try

% Send HTTP request to update ThingSpeak - FIXED APPROACH

response = webread(url); % Using webread instead of webwrite for GET requests

if ~isempty(response) && response >

disp(['Command Sent Successfully: ', commandSent]);

disp(['ThingSpeak Entry ID: ', num2str(response)]);

% Wait for ESP32 to process and update status

disp('Waiting for ESP32 response...');

pause(5);

% Read EV Status from ThingSpeak Field 2

statusURL = ['https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/', channelID, '/fields/2/last.txt?api_key=', readAPIKey];

try

evStatus = webread(statusURL);

disp(['EV Status: ', evStatus]);

catch statusError

disp('Error reading status from ThingSpeak:');

disp(statusError.message);

end

else disp('Failed to send command to ThingSpeak. Response was empty or invalid.'); end

catch webError disp('Error sending command to ThingSpeak:'); disp(webError.message); disp(['URL used: ', url]); end

else disp('Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 6.'); end

## Result:

This experiment demonstrated how MATLAB can be used to remotely control an EV using ThingSpeak API. The system provides a secure, cloud-based approach to IoT-enabled vehicle automation.
